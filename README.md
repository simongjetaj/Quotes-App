# Quotes App

Besides Realtime Database _'Quotes App'_ is built with Cloud Firestore too. The app is deployed with Firebase at https://quotes-app-9e259.firebaseapp.com/ (using Cloud Firestore settings).
* I have set _cloud-firestore_ as a default branch, because here is where I am maintaining the app. ðŸ™‚

* You can also specify the branch (master or cloud-firestore) and run it from
